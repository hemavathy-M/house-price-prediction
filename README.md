# House Price Prediction 🏡

This project is my attempt at building a simple Machine Learning model that can predict house prices based on factors like area, location, and the number of rooms. It's part of my learning journey in applying regression techniques to solve real-world problems.

---

## 📌 Project Overview
The goal is to estimate house prices using historical housing data. I used regression techniques and trained the model to take user inputs (like area or number of bedrooms) and predict the likely price of the house.

## ✅ Features Used
- Total Area (in square feet)
- Location (city or zone)
- Number of Bedrooms (BHK)
- Number of Bathrooms
- Balcony count (optional feature)

---

## 🤖 Algorithm Used
- **Linear Regression** was used for this project due to its simplicity and interpretability.
